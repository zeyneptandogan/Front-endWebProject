# Front-endWebProject

  In this project, an e-commerce website which sells variety of books such as novels, cookbooks is created. The company is called as Bookstore. In the scope of this project,a user can see all the products in the main page, search the products inside of the page. In the profile, user can find the history of shopping, saved credit cards and addresses. While buying the products, the user can use one of the saved credit cards or addresses or the user can enter new address and credit card information. The result of the buying process is given to the user and the stocks are changed accordingly. If the user does not have an account; before buying a product, the user is directed to the sign up page. 
  
  There are also two other roles in the project; these are product manager and sales manager. Admin dashboards are created for each with different specifications and attributes. While product manager can see the bills for the users and follow some charts related to products such as stock situation for each type of books, sales manager can follow the sales by choosing date intervals and change the number of available books in the system. The comments that the users wrote requires the permission of the product manager in order the comment to be visible on the website.
  
  **The front-end of the project was carried out by two group members, including myself.**
